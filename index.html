						<p><u>There are three different ways to cause a catastrophic flood, all use Cloud Seeding methods: </u></p>
						<p>1. Static Cloud Seeding </p>
						<p>This involves spreading a chemical such as silver iodide into clouds. The silver iodide provides a crystal around which moisture condenses. The moisture is already present in the clouds, but the silver iodide essentially makes rain clouds more effective at dispensing their water.</p>
						<p>2. Dynamic Cloud Seeding </p>
						<p>Dynamic Cloud Seeding aims to boost vertical air currents, which encourage more water to pass through the clouds translating into more rain. Up to a hundred times more ice crystals are used in Dynamic Cloud Seeding than the standard method. The process is considered more complex than Static Cloud Seeding because it depends on a sequence of events working properly. An unexpected outcome in one of the two stages could ruin the ability to cause a disaster. </p>
                        <p>3. Hygroscopic Cloud Seeding  </p>
                        <p>This process disperses salts through flares or explosives in the lower portion of clouds. The salt crystals grow in size as the water joins them. The process holds much potential but requires further research. </p>

						<p><u>Rosetta Stone: </u></p>
						<p>A while ago I bought a resin copy of the Rosetta Stone which is meant to be used as a wall piece. Instead I have used it as a placemat on a table.</p>
                        <p>The Rosetta Stone was made in 196 BC, initially displayed in a temple in Memphis, Egypt. The Stone was thought to have been moved during the early Christian period and used as a building material in the construction of a new fort in Rashid. It was re-discovered in 1799 by a French soldier but because the British troops defeated the French in Egypt, they took possession of the Stone and brought it back to London where it has been displayed in the British Museum ever since. The Stone took twenty years to fully decipher. Once it was, it became a historical object no longer holding the same kind of interest. </p>
                        <p>Today the British Museum has many different gifts bearing the symbols of the Rosetta Stone. From wallets, to mugs, to luggage tags, to pens... there are five or six containing Rosetta Stone memorabilia. In a way the gift shop trivialises the significance of what discovering the Rosetta Stone was, but in another way it helps perpetuate the information contained on it further into the future. </p>
                         <p>Rosetta’s name has become synonymous with deciphering and translation. With a language learning website getting more internet hits than the original stone now. In addition to this NASA has also launched a space probe that will perform a detailed study of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. </p>

						<p><u>Ecce Homo</u></p>
						<p>Ecce Homo was probably the most public arts based story in the media back in 2012. I first came across it when a friend pointed it out to me in the London version of Metro newspaper. Most people I knew seemed to find it funny. The lady that tried to touch the painting up obviously did so with good intent. There apparently wasn’t that much appreciation for the original anyway. Personally I liked her for all her efforts. </p>
                        <p>Because of the media sensation that surrounded the story the image is now fairly recognised among the wider public. Now some forty thousand people a year visit the chapel where it was painted. Gimenez, the lady that painted over the original has requested royalties since. I bought a t-shirt bearing the image.</p>

                        <p>We followed Lubo into the forest. We didn’t speak a word of his and neither his ours. Occasionally he held his hand out flat from his side signalling us to stop, slow down or walk quietly. We waited in the forest where Lubo made deer calls with a horn as dusk fell. The gun went up but we never caught sight of a deer despite hearing one nearby.</p>
						<p>Later that night we helped some other hunters drag a dead deer from the back of a trailer into the abattoir. The smell was overwhelming. There was a rich iron smell in the still warm blood mixed in with the smooth earthly smell of the forest.</p>

                        <p>His gravestone reads: "Don't Try", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington. "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't – I told them – You don't try. That's very important: <i>not</i> to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it."</p>

						<p><u>Hole in the Hard Drive</u></p>
                        <p>Technologies become ever increasingly mysterious.

                         <p>It’s pretty brutal drilling through a hard drive like this, I started just on the floor of my bedroom but it kept spinning the whole things as the drill bit started to bite. Once I found a way to clamp it the process destroyed the motor on my drill. I then had to take it to work to use a bigger drill, taking nearly half an hour to finally get right through it.</p>
                          <p>I don’t quite understand what has happened to the information that was on the hard drive now - whether it has gone, is hidden or has now changed into something else.</p>

						<p><u>Chauvet Cave</u></p>
                        <p>A rock is not large, but the consideration of the time the rock has experienced is large. An experience similar to this occurs in Werner Herzog’s film <i>Cave of Forgotten Dreams</i> <sup>1</sup> about the Chauvet Cave, Southern France. In the film we are shown footage of the cave walls covered in numerous ancient cave paintings. Herzog explains: ‘after carbon dating there are strong indications that some of the overlapping figures were drawn almost five thousand years apart. The sequence and duration of time is unimaginable for us today; we are locked in history and they were not.’</p>

						<p><u>9/11 Postcard</u>  </p>
                        <p>In 2011 I visited New York for the first time. We were on the subway headed downtown and saw the World Trade Centre marked on the map. We didn’t really have any plans that day so decided to take a look around Ground Zero and see how work on the new buildings were coming on. When we arrived I realised how lightly I had taken the decision to go there – strangely, there was almost nothing to see. Later that night I couldn’t sleep thinking about 9/11, I was 17 when it happened and didn’t know what the Twin Towers were. I began re-watching the footage on youtube, and started looking at Twin Towers related things on eBay. I came across this postcard made by Michael Langstein in 1978, the postcard is an artwork titled Two in Time. This postcard led me to nearly a year’s worth of research, the outcome of it never really made sense as an artwork.  </p>

A plastic bag can last hundreds of years and I only have 2500 weeks left to live.

						<p><u>Burning a tree </u></p>
                        <p>A few years ago I was ask to make a proposal for an artwork at Cowley Manor. I had the idea of burning a tree down, a perfectly healthy tree. There was something uniquely sad about carrying out this act. I started to put the proposal together but never even bothered to ask them. The spectacle of seeing a tree burning is still something I’d like to witness. </p>

The story goes that NASA picked the blackest part of the night sky and programmed the Hubble Telescope to start building up an image of it over the course of six months. Apparently they weren’t expecting to get an image back, instead the image exposed looked back 13 million years and contained around ten thousand galaxies. </p>

                        <p>Mondrian was probably the first artist I really loved. I can’t remember what initially attracted me to him but somewhere in the continual reduction of his painting was a beautiful ending – a rare sight in art. Mondrian’s artistic direction accidentally foresaw what was later understood by neurologists to be the breakdown of how the mind makes up an image. When I finally got the chance to get close to one in Tate Modern I was strangely pleased how sketchy they seemed, they were still human. </p>

						<p><u>Experimental Ruins</u> </p>
                        <p>In September 2012 I went on a bus tour organised by Neal White with The Arts Catalyst in London. The tour took us around some of the post Cold War military sites in the South of England. I’d never really thought that the war is still going on. It’s just become nearly invisible. We drove around the perimeter of two nuclear testing sites just outside Reading on the M4, they were both massive. One appeared to be developing with several cranes hovering over a construction site. Because we were on a bus we could just about see over the fence to some of the facilities within the site. We encountered some mound shaped buildings which were constructed in such a way that if any problem occurred while working with the nuclear material inside an emergency button could be hit causing it to collapse on top of them. </p>

                        <p>“We take off into the cosmos, ready for anything: for solitude, for hardship, for exhaustion, death. Modesty forbids us to say so, but there are times when we think pretty well of ourselves. And yet, if we examine it more closely, our enthusiasm turns out to be all a sham. We don't want to conquer the cosmos, we simply want to extend the boundaries of Earth to the frontiers of the cosmos. For us, such and such a planet is as arid as the Sahara, another as frozen as the North Pole, yet another as lush as the Amazon basin. We are humanitarian and chivalrous; we don't want to enslave other races, we simply want to bequeath them our values and take over their heritage in exchange. We think of ourselves as the Knights of the Holy Contact. This is another lie. We are only seeking Man. We have no need of other worlds. A single world, our own, suffices us; but we can't accept it for what it is. We are searching for an ideal image of our own world: we go in quest of a planet, a civilization superior to our own but developed on the basis of a prototype of our primeval past. At the same time, there is something inside us which we don't like to face up to, from which we try to protect ourselves, but which nevertheless remains, since we don't leave Earth in a state of primal innocence. We arrive here as we are in reality, and when the page is turned and that reality is revealed to us - that part of our reality which we would prefer to pass over in silence - then we don't like it anymore.” </p>

						<p><u>A piece of a Steel</u> </p>
                        <p>In 2011 I went to see an exhibition at the Imperial War Museum showing one of the pieces of the World Trade Centre that had been kept after the wreckage of the building had been moved to a hangar on the outskirts of New York. It struck me that this was almost like some kind of secondary explosion of the building, throwing parts of the WTC all over the world. Ten years on from 9/11 the events were still very much in the memory of my friends and family. They could recall where they were, what they were doing that day and seeing the footage of the planes flying into each of the towers. </p>
                        <p>The piece of the WTC on display was covered in rust, already indicating the event was some time ago. The surface had not been cleaned while in the exhibition so was covered in dust and fluff that was in the gallery air, giving the impression that it was uncomfortable to touch or perhaps treated differently because it didn’t belong to the museum.</p>
                        <p>What’s even more strange is just next to it is the booth where the Lockebie Bombers confessed. </p>
                        <p>For me nothing will ever be more harrowing than seeing all of the grave yards close to the Normandy landing beaches when I was 10 years old. The scale of what had happened was instantly physically recognisable. </p>

						<p>‘It seems I can just wish things into existence. Especially pictures: whatever image I imagine, or hope for, seems to be already there, waiting, as if heaven sent. I used to believe that this was because I had a good searching ability. I’m good at gathering information – that’s part of what makes me a contemporary artist – but as I continue to access the Tail, this sense of cybernetic serendipity starts to seem less like a series of happy accidents and more a program of intelligent design. It seems the Tail is anti…cipating me. It seems that the feedback mechanisms of the Tail, through my repeated successive uses, my continuous input, has assembled a profile, an extensive profile of my needs, my preferences … and from this information – the extracted accumulation of all my deepest wishes – is creating content conjured up from my subconscious, scraping the vaguest memories and half forgotten images from my mind. The system understands my needs and can continue the process I initiated without my real involvement. </p>
                        <p>This is psychedelic – literally mind-mani-festing – as all my psychic energy is seemingly converted into visible light. Fluid photographs of thought crystallise in front of me, as complicated and varied as anything real … And as all my mental pictures coagulate and contribute their mass to the already prodigious Tail, I become aware that they are but part of this wondrously complex mesh of memory, sight, sex, and consciousness that is ceaselessly generating these marvels. And I begin to understand the Tail is unfathomably long, that it reaches back through geological amounts of time, circles back to an archaic state of being, an aboriginal world of primal pleasures; that its transformative technology that allows humans to morph into animals, the marvelous become everyday, and the ancestral dead brought into our living company, is a return to a sense that everything is on and of this earth is being animated from within. All of its constituents – the mechanical, the imagined and the living. The Tail, then, is a landscape of fabulous hybrid creatures, images endowed with divine powers and familiar objects full of voices, where even rocks and stones have names.’</p>

I created my interior thoughts as a means of production for the corporation that owned the board I was posting to... and that commodity was being sold to other commodity/consumer entities as entertainment... Cyberspace is a black hole. It absorbs energy and personality and then re-presents it as an emotional spectacle.'</p>

						<p><u>GSA and the constant threat of becoming a museum</u> </p>
                        <p>I have a few friends that were lucky enough to have studied in the Mackintosh Building. All of them have spoken on their worry of the building becoming a museum at some point rather than staying as an art school. Since the fire happening in 2014 there is even more ground from which to argue that the building should be a museum only. Currently the building is a kind of hybrid, housing a number of Painting Students while having a few areas dedicated for the public to visit. Our era of museuming has a lasting effect, creating bizarre hierarchies of objects and places that were originally meant to be used. </p>

						<p><u>11 <sup>th</sup> September 2001</u> </p>
                        <p>It was early afternoon, I had just finished college and was waiting for a bus to arrive at St. Peter’s Square in Hereford. Coincidentally, the only friend I had with any American connection pulled over in his Jeep when he saw me, his dad is American. ‘Have you heard?’ he said, ‘apparently two planes have flown into the Twin Towers.’ ‘What are they?’ I asked, not really having a clue what he was going on about. He explained that they were in New York and they were the largest buildings on the skyline, he then invited me to get into the car with him back to his place to watch the day unfold on his big Sony television. </p>
                        <p>We both had a sense of urgency to reach the television to actually see some footage of what had happened. Because I have re-watched the footage so many times, it’s difficult for me to really remember watching the second plane make impact on the South Tower for the first time. Seeing the plane bank to align itself with the tower was so mesmerising that it was difficult to imagine that any person was involved in the event. The footage was just looping continuously, even the news crews seem to be lost for words.</p>
                        <p>After watching the first tower collapse, I decided to give my dad a call to see what he was making of it. He answered the phone with his usual ‘Hullo?’ I asked him if he had seen the news, ‘no’ he said, I was surprised, my dad is always on top of what’s going in the news. ‘Turn the TV on’ I told him. ‘What channel?’ he asked, ‘take your pick’ I said, feeling sort of amazed that I knew before him. </p>
                        <p>The rest of that day kind of fades away for me, I think I stayed at my friend’s house for a fair few hours. I don’t remember the conversations I had at the time at all, there must have been points where we were discussing what we were seeing and its significance. Perhaps this is testament to how well images travel through time, and the words are often lost.</p>

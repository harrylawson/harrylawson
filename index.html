						<p><u>There are three different ways to cause a catastrophic flood, all use Cloud Seeding methods: </u></p>
						<p>1. Static Cloud Seeding </p>
						<p>This involves spreading a chemical such as silver iodide into clouds. The silver iodide provides a crystal around which moisture condenses. The moisture is already present in the clouds, but the silver iodide essentially makes rain clouds more effective at dispensing their water.</p>
						<p>2. Dynamic Cloud Seeding </p>
						<p>Dynamic Cloud Seeding aims to boost vertical air currents, which encourage more water to pass through the clouds translating into more rain. Up to a hundred times more ice crystals are used in Dynamic Cloud Seeding than the standard method. The process is considered more complex than Static Cloud Seeding because it depends on a sequence of events working properly. An unexpected outcome in one of the two stages could ruin the ability to cause a disaster. </p>
                        <p>3. Hygroscopic Cloud Seeding  </p>
                        <p>This process disperses salts through flares or explosives in the lower portion of clouds. The salt crystals grow in size as the water joins them. The process holds much potential but requires further research. </p>

						<p><u>Rosetta Stone: </u></p>
						<p>A while ago I bought a resin copy of the Rosetta Stone which is meant as a wall piece. Instead I have used it as a placemat on a table.</p>
                        <p>The Rosetta Stone was made in 196 BC, initially displayed in a temple in Memphis, Egypt. The Stone was thought to have been moved during the early Christian period and used as a building material in the construction of a new fort in Rashid. It was re-discovered in 1799 by a French soldier but because the British troops defeated the French in Egypt, they took possession of the Stone and brought it back to London where it has been displayed in the British Museum ever since. The Stone took twenty years to fully decipher. Once it was, it became a historical object no longer holding the same kind of interest. </p>
                        <p>Today the British Museum has many different gifts bearing the symbols of the Rosetta Stone. From wallets, to mugs, to luggage tags, to pens... there are some three stands containing Rosetta Stone memorabilia. In a way the gift shop trivialises the significance of what discovering the Rosetta Stone was, but in another way it helps perpetuate the information contained on it further into the future. </p>

						<p><u>Ecce Homo</u></p>
						<p>Ecce Homo was probably the most public arts based story in the media back in 2012. I first came across it when a friend pointed it out to me in the London version of Metro newspaper. Most people I knew seemed to find it funny. The lady that tried to touch the painting up obviously did so with good intent. There apparently wasn’t that much appreciation for the original anyway. Personally I liked her for all her efforts. </p>
                        <p>Because of the media sensation that surrounded the story the image is now fairly recognised among the wider public. Now some forty thousand people a year visit the chapel where it was painted. Gimenez, the lady that painted over the original has requested royalties since. I bought a t-shirt bearing the image.</p>

                        <p>We followed Lubo into the forest. We didn’t speak a word of his and neither his ours. Occasionally he held his hand out flat from his side signalling us to stop, slow down or walk quietly. We waited in the forest where Lubo made deer calls with a horn as dusk fell. The gun went up but we never caught sight of a deer despite hearing one nearby.</p>
						<p>Later that night we helped some other hunters drag a dead deer from the back of a trailer into the abattoir. The smell was overwhelming. There was a rich iron smell in the still warm blood mixed in with the smooth earthly smell of the forest.</p>

                        <p>His gravestone reads: "Don't Try", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: <i>not</i> to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it."</p>

						<p><u>Hole in the Hard Drive</u></p>
                        <p>Technologies become ever increasingly mysterious.

                         <p>It’s pretty brutal drilling through a hard drive like this, I started just on the floor of my bedroom but it kept spinning the whole things as the drill bit started to bite. Once I found a way to clamp it the process destroyed the motor on my drill. I then had to take it to work to use a bigger drill, taking nearly half an hour to finally get right through it.</p>
                          <p>I don’t quite understand what has happened to the information that was on the hard drive now - whether it has gone, is hidden or has now changed into something else.</p>

A while before I had scratched at the surface of the wall and noticed the different paint layers embedded in it. We took a section out of the wall for the Zee show, I begged my boss to give it to me and after much effort he eventually agreed. Etching back the surface with a knife was one of the earliest things I did when I started my first year at the RCA.

                        <p>In 2011 I visited New York for the first time. We were on the subway headed downtown and saw the World Trade Centre marked on the map. We didn’t really have any plans that day so decided to take a look around Ground Zero and see how work on the new buildings were coming on. When we arrived I realised how lightly I had taken the decision to go there – strangely, there was almost nothing to see. Later that night I couldn’t sleep thinking about 9/11, I was 17 when it happened and didn’t know what the Twin Towers were. I began re-watching the footage on youtube, and started looking at Twin Towers related things on eBay. I came across this postcard made by Michael Langstein in 1978, the postcard is an artwork titled Two in Time. This postcard led me to nearly a year’s worth of research, the outcome of it never really made sense as an artwork.  </p>

						<p><u>Ultra Deep Field Experiment</u> </p>
                        <p>I’m always surprised how few people know about this experiment considering how much attention it seems to get in the media, but it just shows that once you are attuned to something you can see it everywhere. The story goes that NASA picked the blackest part of the night sky and programmed the Hubble Telescope to start building up an image of it over the course of six months. Apparently they weren’t expecting to get an image back, instead the image exposed looked back 13 million years and contained around ten thousand galaxies. </p>

                        <p>This has been the title of a work I have wanted to make pretty much since I started my MA. It comes up time and time again in my sketchbook notes. I knew the object I used for this piece would need to have some kind of personal resonance as well, I’ve just not seen it yet.</p>

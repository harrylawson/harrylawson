						<p><u>An Introduction to this website</u></p>
                        <p>This website is to give you some idea of some of the things and thoughts Iâ€™ve had over the years from my art process. It could be seen as a set of recommendations from me to you. Personally I feel they are all intimately linked.</p>
                        <p>At the core of my practice is an interest in how objects help knowledge travel into the future, and what happens to them on their journey: how their meaning changes, gets lost, re-interpreted, exaggerated, misunderstood, re-found and trivialised. I try to be as direct as I can, though working with historical material is slippery in its meaning. </p>
                        <p>This website was designed in collaboration with <a class="name" href="http://www.alessandrobrunetti.com">Alessandro Brunetti</a> and developed by Michal Fiedorowicz</p>

						<p><u>There are three different ways to cause a catastrophic flood, all use Cloud Seeding methods: </u></p>
						<p>1. Static Cloud Seeding </p>
						<p>This involves spreading a chemical such as silver iodide into clouds. The silver iodide provides a crystal around which moisture condenses. The moisture is already present in the clouds, but the silver iodide essentially makes rain clouds more effective at dispensing their water.</p>
						<p>2. Dynamic Cloud Seeding </p>
						<p>Dynamic Cloud Seeding aims to boost vertical air currents, which encourage more water to pass through the clouds translating into more rain. Up to a hundred times more ice crystals are used in Dynamic Cloud Seeding than the standard method. The process is considered more complex than Static Cloud Seeding because it depends on a sequence of events working properly. An unexpected outcome in one of the two stages could ruin the ability to cause a disaster. </p>
                        <p>3. Hygroscopic Cloud Seeding  </p>
                        <p>This process disperses salts through flares or explosives in the lower portion of clouds. The salt crystals grow in size as the water joins them. The process holds much potential but requires further research. </p>
